# Changes to the original

The base Caffe version for this modification is from March 12th, 2017 and can be found here: [https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/e687a71fac81718d40d4e0e98d29eab34f784b5b](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/e687a71fac81718d40d4e0e98d29eab34f784b5b). 

### Multiple labels in image data layer

The image data layer in current Caffe supports only one integer label to be defined in the text file for a single image.

    0002.jpg 1
    0003.jpg 2

With the modifications done in this version, you can define multiple floating-point numbers, as in the example below.

    0001.jpg 0.345 1.364 -4.124
    0002.jpg 6.321 5.246 6.235
    0003.jpg 4.135 -5.356 1.345
